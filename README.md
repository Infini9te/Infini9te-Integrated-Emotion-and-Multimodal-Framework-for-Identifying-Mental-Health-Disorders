This project aims to create a comprehensive system for assessing childrenâ€™s emotional states and attention levels through a multimodal approach. By integrating methods such as facial expression analysis, monitoring of physiological indicators (e.g., heart rate variation and skin conductance), and behavioral analysis, this system seeks to detect signs of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The goal is to develop a reliable tool that supports early detection and intervention, promoting improved mental health outcomes for children.
